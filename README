Brainfuck Interpreter and Compiler
----------------------------------

This package is distributed with an accompanying DISCLAIMER. If you
don't intend to sue me, you probably don't have to read this file.

Notes: The C source code is provided for reference. The binaries were
built on a MinGW cross compiler. The code can be compiled in MSVC with some
modifications.

Interpretation Usage: 
To interpret a .b file, say bottles.b, use: brainfuck bottles.b

Compilation Usage:
To compile the file, you require an assembler/linker along with it.

bfx86 bottles.b will yield the assembly source file: bottles.b.s

The .s file can compile with GNU as (part of MinGW on Windows) or with yasm.

For MinGW/*nix(with gcc), use: gcc -o bottles bottles.b.s

On *nix, you can also use the compile script shipped alongwith. use:
compile bottles.b

For MSVC, you require the yasm assembler:
use: yasm -p gas -f win32 bottles.b.s -o bottles.obj
     link -OUT:bottles.exe bottles.obj

Then you can execute the appropriate file.
